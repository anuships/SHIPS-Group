    <!-- Strings related to flight factsheet -->
    <string name="principle_of_flight">In physics, we define force as an interaction that can change the motion of an object. In order to make an aircraft flying, there are different forces acting on the plane like the picture shown above. They are the thrust of the engine, drag force from the resistance, the gravity force of the aircraft itself and the lifting force of the air.</string>
    <string name="lift">To make a plane rise into the air, the force needs to exceed the weight force. That force is called lift. In most cases, lift is created by the flow of air over an airfoil (Any surface designed to help lift an aircraft with the use of air current). Apparently, you can say that the lift keeps the aircraft up.\nMisconceptions: The key point for airplane to fly is not the engine. In another word, even all engines stop, an airplane can still glide down.</string>
    <string name="weight">Weight is the gravity force, a force that pulls everything towards the earth’s surface, of the airplane itself. It is an unavoidable force acting on the plane according to Newton’s law.</string>
    <string name="drag">In Physics, everything that goes through the air will experience a resistance force, in this case, the resistance is called drag.</string>>
    <string name="thrust">Thrust is the force to make the object move. In this case, thrust from the engine is the power source of the aircraft.</string>
    <string name="how_does_aircraft_work">When a plane is flying in the constant speed, the aircraft is in equivalent, meaning it is balanced. Then the lift force is equal to the weight and the thrust is equal to the drag. If the aircraft is not balanced, meaning the aircraft will speed up, slow down or change direction.</string>
    <string name="turbulence">Turbulence is occurred when the airplane fly through one varied air current to another. This is the most common thing that scares us about flying. There are a few situations might cause turbulence. \nFirst is the convective currents, heat generated from the radioactive decay of elements deep in the interior of the Earth creates magma (molten rock) in the asthenosphere and cause air rise.\nSecond one is obstructions to wind flow and it can cause all kinds of eddies and current.\nThe last one is windshear or wind gradient, this is the difference in wind speed or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere.\nIt is hyperbolic to say that turbulence is super dangerous but we can’t say that turbulence is not dangerous at all. There are four main danger of turbulence.\nFirst one is structural failure. It is true that small and general planes might get destroyed in the thunderstorms. But for commercial airplanes, they have radar on-board to spot and avoid thunderstorm. So don’t worry about this when you are flying in commercial airplanes.\nSecond one is passenger injury. ‘Fasten seat belt’ sign is necessary especially when the airplane is flying into downward-moving air. Most cases when passenger get injured are people who didn’t fasten their seat belts all the time.\nThe third danger is altitude loss near ground. Altitude changed rapidly can also be one of the dangers turbulence can get. This danger can usually caused by wake turbulence, a disturbance in the atmosphere that forms behind an aircraft as it passes through the air, and thunderstorms.\nThe last one is wind changes near the ground.</string>
    <string name="airline_accident_rate1">ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organisation is a specialised agency of the United Nations. They publish annual ICAO Safety Reports every year and the report provided updates on safety indicators, including accidents and related risk factors.\nIn 2017 annual ICAO Safety report, some statement has included in the accident statistics report.</string>
    <string name="airline_accident_rate2">From the chart 1 above, it indicated that the accident rate in 2016 has decreased and it is the lowest record ever.\nThere are many different factors can cause the flight accidents. According to ICAO, in the 2017-2019 Global Aviation Safety Plan ICAO has included three high-risk accident occurrence categories (HRC) as the Global Safety Priorities. They are runway safety related events (RS), loss of control inflight (LOC-I) and controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). Also ICAO uses these three high-risk accident categories as a baseline in its safety analysis.</string>
    <string name="sound">Most people who have flying phobia are scared of the noises or some strange sound during the flight, especially when you don’t know what causes them. So there are a few sounds might be able to help you with recognizing the sound.\n• Right after taking-off, the landing gear will be retracted and cause a thumping sound\n• You might also hear a whirring sound as a motor retracts the flaps and spoilers. (These are made to stick out of the back of the wings in order to add extra lift on take-off and to help slow the airplane on descent.)\n• You might hear the engines throttle back when levelling off for cruise.\n• You might hear whirring sounds as flaps and spoilers are extended for descent and landing.\n• Before landing, you will hear thumping as the landing gear comes down again same as the taking-off one.</string>

    <string name="exposure_introduction">This platform provides systematic desensitization as a therapeutic tool for people with fear of flying. Different stimuli which are related to flying will be presented to people with the increasing level of stimulation to allow people applying different relaxation skills to help them get accustomed to the flying.</string>
    <string name="exposure_description">Firstly, you will see a photo related to the flying which may increase your body arousal on the screen. If you feel uncomfortable with the photo, you can press the "Stop" button to stop it. Then, you can click the "Relaxation" button to practice different relaxation skills to reduce your body arousal. If you are no longer being nervous with current photo, you can change the exposure level, the higher level you choose, it is supposed that the photo will result in higher level of arousal to you. Therefore, make sure you choose an appropriate level of exposure first. In some levels, the stimuli maybe both visual and audio, make sure you use a earphone before the exposure starts.</string>
